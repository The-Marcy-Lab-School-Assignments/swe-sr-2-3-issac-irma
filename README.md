## Prompt 1

What are the main differences between Flexbox and Grid layouts? Describe scenarios where each layout system would be more suitable.

### Response 1
Flexbox layout is used to distribute spaces between items and we can align them, the only issue is that we can only do it in a row or a column. The best time to use this layout is when we are working inside a container. 
A grid layout on the other hand is used to adjust the size, position, and layers but this time we can adjust them in a row *and/or* in a column. The best time to use this layout is when we are working on a container. 

## Prompt 2

What is the difference between `justify-content` and `align-items` in Flexbox? How does each property control the positioning of flex items within the container?

### Response 2
Justify-content is used to align the flexible container items when items do not use all available space on the main axis. It controls the positioning of flex items when items don't use all of the space available. Align-items are used as a default alignment for items, otherwise known as the cross-axis. It controls the positioning of flex items when  They are both used inside a flexbox or grid container. We can think of justify-content as the x-axis and align-items as the y-axis. 


## Prompt 3

Describe the difference between `grid-template-areas` and `grid-template-columns`/`grid-template-rows`. When might you prefer one approach over the other?
